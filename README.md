# VanillaExpanded

## Overview

VanillaExpanded is a mod for VintageStory that aims to add quality-of-life enhancements, missing functionality, and minor bug fixes while remaining true to the vanilla game and with minimal impacts to game balance.

## Features

### Auto-Stash

You can now bulk transfer matching items from your inventory into storage containers!

1) When interacting with a container, hold the `interact` button (default: right-click).
2) If you have items in your inventory which match items already in the container, a brief progress-bar will be shown at the center of the screen.
3) After the progress-bar completes, all matching items from your inventory will be moved into the container.

### New Hotkeys

- Hotkey for quickly swapping a light source into the off-hand (default: `F`) or hotbar (default: `Shift + F`) when available (press again to swap the light source back into its prior slot).

### Quality of Life Additions

- Player respawn point appears as a glowing gear symbol on the ground.

### Implemented Missing Functionalities

- Ignitable things (firepits, etc) can now be ignited using lanterns (_oillamps & candles pending_).

### New Recipes

_Note: for decrafting recipes_  
_A low-tier tool (e.g. knife) yields ~50% of the original materials._  
_A high-tier tool (e.g. saw or shears) yields ~70% of the original materials._  

- Planks & Firewood can be cut into sticks using a knife or saw (saw yields more).
- Linen & Leather bags can be de-crafted back into their crafting components using a knife or shears (shears yield more).
- Wattle fences/gates can be de-crafted back into sticks and wattle using a knife or saw (saw yields more).
- Metal tool-heads can be de-crafted back into metal ingots using a chisel.
- Metal arrow-heads can be de-crafted back into metal ingots using a chisel.
